# Thyroid Cancer Risk Dashboard
Thyroid cancer is one of the most common types of endocrine cancer, affecting the thyroid gland located at the base of the neck. It is estimated that more than **2,00,000 cases** of thyroid cancer are diagnosed globally each year, and the number continues to rise. Fortunately, the survival rate for thyroid cancer is high, with a 5-year survival rate of over **98%** when detected early.


## Problem Statement
 * Identify and observe the factors responsible for Thyroid Cancer to gain insights and find patterns.
 * Find and compare the Thryroid Cancer contraction likelihood across various ethnic and geographic makeups.
 * Interpret and deliver insights that may help in early detection and potential prevention of the disease.

## Tools used
* MS Excel and Power Query for data cleaning and feature addition
* PowerBI Desktop for data visualization and data modeling

## Dataset
Data source : Kaggle

Link to raw dataset : [Thyroid Cancer Risk Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhargavchirumamilla/thyroid-cancer-risk-dataset/data)

## Data Analysis

Performed the three-step process ETL by extracting the raw dataset from Kaggle website and loading it into Microsoft Excel for data validation and data cleaning. Transformed the data using Power Query into Qualitative and Quantitative tables for better segregation and ease of access, added features by manipulating existing data columns, and loaded the transformed data into Power BI Desktop for further analysis and visualization.
